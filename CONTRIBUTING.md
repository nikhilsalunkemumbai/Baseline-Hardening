# Contributing to Baseline-Hardening

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project aims to provide high-quality, minimal-dependency technical building blocks for security auditing and infrastructure resilience.

## How to Contribute

1.  **Improve Existing Snippets:** If you find a bug or a more efficient way to implement a design in PowerShell, Bash, Python, or SQLite, please submit a pull request.
2.  **Add New Technologies:** We currently focus on the four core technologies mentioned. If you'd like to add implementations in other standard languages (like Go or Rust) for existing designs, contributions are welcome.
3.  **Propose New Designs:** If you have a concept for a new IT utility that fits the "Baseline Hardening" theme, please open an issue to discuss it.
4.  **Refine Documentation:** Help us make the tutorials and exercises clearer and more educational.

## Contribution Guidelines

-   **Minimal Dependencies:** Favor standard libraries and built-in OS utilities. Avoid third-party packages unless absolutely necessary.
-   **Cross-Platform:** Ensure your code works (or has clear fallback logic) across Windows, Linux, and macOS.
-   **Structured Output:** Where applicable, snippets should output structured data (e.g., JSON).
-   **Educational Value:** Maintain the clear, step-by-step structure of the tutorials and exercises.
-   **Framework Alignment:** Every new file should include a "Framework Alignment" section explaining its relevance to system hardening and auditing.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your feature or fix.
